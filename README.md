# Enose-dataset-Copd-vs-Controls
Exhaled breath analysis measuring Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) through an e-nose device for discriminating between patients diagnosed with COPD and healthy individuals

This is a first preliminary analysis on the dataset published by Acevedo, C. M. D., Vasquez, C. A. C., & GÃ³mez, J. K. C. (2021). Electronic nose dataset for COPD detection from smokers and healthy people through exhaled breath analysis. Data in Brief, 35, 106767.

The dataset is open for download using the link https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/h5pcn99zw4/4 (2 MB). The dataset consists of tabular data (csv format). Actually, the folder contains 5 ".csv" files. The whole dataset includes 2 measurements for each of the 8 metal oxide sensors for 10 Controls, 20 Patients, 4 Smokers and 5 from the Air.

The format of the title of each column translates as follows: S # (index of Sensor) | (A D C S) # (index of individual) | # (index for repeated measurement)
S- refers to the Sensor
A- refers to the measurement of the ambient Air during the measurements for each group
D- refers to patients diagnosed with COPD
C- refers to the Healthy individuals (Controls)
S (this refers to the second S in the Parenthesis) - refers to the Smokers
'#' - refers to the actual number (as index) of the Sensor, patient, healthy individual, Smoker or measurement of the Air and finally the number of measurement
